            <h2>My Background:</h2>
                <p>Prior to coming to Flatiron School to pursue a career in software engineering <br> I worked in the real estate industry in a number of capacities including property <br> management as well as residential leasing. My experience in real estate helped <br> me realize what it is that I really want to do, help people and solve problems! <br> I hope to use my past experiences to help me become the best software engineer <br> possible. Using my problem solving skills and interacting with people on a day-to-day <br> basis is what I love.
